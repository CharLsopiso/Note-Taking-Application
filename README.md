# Note-Taking-Application
The note-taking application is an application code where you can add, show, delete, find, and edit your notes. It is perfect for you to use in the sense that it helps to remind us of our meetings to attend and activities and tasks that we need to finish, do, and review before the start of the class or to prepare us for the next lessons.
